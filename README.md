# Digimun
Digimun is a web application I created to help run Model United Nations conferences. The application is still a WIP and has many bugs that need to be solved.  

Run:  
In order to run the application, open two terminals.  
  
In the first terminal:  
cd backend  
npm install  
npm run start  
  
In the second terminal:  
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev
