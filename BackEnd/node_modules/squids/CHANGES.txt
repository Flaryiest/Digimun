v6.0.2 -> v6.2.0
----------------

	- added pointer events; deprecated mouse events

v6.0.2 -> v6.1.0
----------------

	- Squids now have text and font properties which can be set; if set the text sill be rendered using the font.
	- Removed clone() method of squid object introducted in v6.0.0


v6.0.1 -> v6.0.2
----------------

	- Fixed: squid's destroy() method failed to remove squid from sorted_draw_listeners[]
	- Added support for squids logo screen and the ability to override it.

v6.0.0 -> v6.0.1
----------------
    - changed input, animatedSprite, and aspectScaling to use Squid instead of Thing

v5.5.0 -> v6.0.0
----------------

	- The rndhun() function was removed from squids core
	- The seq() function was made global
	- The load_image() and load_sound() functions no longer use a caching mechanism.  They always try to load the asset from it's file/url.
	- load_image() cleans up after itself better.
	- fill_rect() takes two additional optional arguments 'opacity' and 'rotation'
	- draw_rect() takes two additional optional arguments 'opacity' and 'rotation'
	- draw_line() takes 1 additional optional argument 'opacity'
	- draw_circle() takes 1 additional optional argument 'opacity'
	- draw_cross() takes two additional optional arguments 'opacity' and 'rotation'
	- Debug mode draws the collision rectangles, squid location, and image rectangle somewhat differently.
	- The Thing object and constructor is removed and its functionaly (which was essentially just being an event listener) was moved into the Squid object.
	- There is a new function destroy_all_squids() which calls destroy() on all squids instantiated through the Squid() constructor
	- The id of squids is now immutable
	- There is a new function stop_all_audio() that does what it says.
	- There is a new function reset() that calls destroy_all_squids() and stop_all_audio()
	- There is now a method clone() on instantiated squid objects that creates a clone of a squid, except for the event listeners.
	- The simple_draw() functions is now global
	- The play() method of Anim how takes an optional argument start_frame.
	- There is a new method restart() of Anim that just calls play(0).
	- A bug in collide_pos_squid() was fixed (thanks Rap)
	- The main tick loop is now driven by setInterval() instead of setTimeout().
	- The draw_0 through draw_5 events are gone; There is now only one draw event and you set visual priority be calling the squid's draw_priority(n) method; So there is no longer a limit on the # of visual priority levels.  Note that the downside of this is that any time you call draw_priority() for listen() for the draw event, an array of squids will be resorted which is somewhat intensive.  Recommend calling those functions as rarely as possible.
	- The pre_draw and post_draw events were removed. 
	- There are now 2 globals fps_tick and fps_draw which can be read at any time and contain an approximate numbers for how many ticks and draws are happening per second; Ideally.
	- tick(true) is called automatically when squids is initialized, so your game doesn't need to do it anymore.  Though you can still call tick() to turn ticking on off as before.
