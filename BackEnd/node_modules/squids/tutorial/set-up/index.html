	<h1>Setting Up For Development With Squids </h1>
	<p>
	Squids is not intended to be extremely flexible or powerful.
	It's designed to be <i>extremely easy to learn and use</i>.
	As such, you won't be able to make <i>any game</i> you can imagine with it.
	But you can make some really great games and you will learn a lot about how
	game engines and game development work.
	<p>

	<p>
	Squids games are written in Javascript and run within a web page.
	Squids doesn't provide any editors or other tools.
	You must know how to create a web page and include javascript files.
	</p>

	<p>
	You are strongly urged to start by downloading the
	<a href="https://squids.sleepless.com/joe/">example game</a>,
	reading through the code, and starting with that as template.
	It consists of:
	<ul>
		<li> A small HTML file "<a href="https://squids.sleepless.com/joe/index.html" download >index.html</a>"
		<li> The Squids code, "<a href="https://squids.sleepless.com/joe/squids.js" download>squids.js</a>"
		<li> The code for game itself "<a href="https://squids.sleepless.com/joe/game.js" download>game.js</a>"
	</ul>
